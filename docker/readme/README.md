## Introduction
**AI Data Advisor (AIDA)** is a new component of HCL Workload Automation V10.1, based on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques. It enables fast and simplified data-driven decision making for an intelligent workload management. By analyzing workload historical data and metrics gathered by HCL Workload Automation and predicting their future patterns, AIDA identifies anomalies in KPIs trend (such as the jobs in plan by status and the jobs in plan by workstation) and sends immediate alerts to prevent problems and delays. Alerts show up on the Workload Dashboard and can be notified via email.

For more information about AIDA, see [AIDA User's Guide](https://help.hcltechsw.com/workloadautomation/v101/common/src_ai/awsaimst_welcome.html).


## Prerequisites

 -  HCL Workload Automation V10.1 exposed metrics.
    - For information about HCL Workload Automation exposed metrics, see [Exposing metrics to monitor your workload](https://help.hcltechsw.com/workloadautomation/v101/distr/src_ref/awsrgmonprom.html).  
    - For information about HCL Workload Automation for Z exposed metrics, see [Exposing metrics to monitor your workload](https://help.hcltechsw.com/workloadautomation/v101/zos/src_man/eqqr1metricsmonitoring.html).  

 -  Docker Compose 1.28 or later.

    Docker 19.x or later.

    Verify that Docker and Docker Compose are installed, configured, and ready to use.
	
 -  Supported browsers are: 
	- Google Chrome 67.0.3396.99 or higher
    - Mozilla Firefox 61.0.1 or higher 
    - Microsoft Edge 79 or higher

 -  External container image for Elasticsearch (OpenSearch 2.3.0).

 -  External container image for Keycloak (JBoss Keycloak V17.0.0). Optional, if you want to access AIDA UI from outside the Dynamic Workload Console.
 
 -  Before starting AIDA installation, verify that `vm.max_map_count` parameter for Elasticsearch is at minimum 262144 on the host machine (not inside the container). 
 
    -  To get the current value, run the command: `sysctl vm.max_map_count`  
	
    -  To set the new value, run the command: `sudo sysctl vm.max_map_count=262144`


##  Resources Required

 The following resources correspond to the default values required to manage a production environment. These numbers might vary depending on the environment.
 
| Component | Container resource limit | Container memory request |
|--|--|--|
|**AIDA**  | CPU: 6, Memory: 32Gi, Storage: 50Gi |CPU: 2, Memory: 8Gi, Storage: 20Gi  |


## Supported platforms
Linux intel based 64-bit, and Linux on Z.


## Accessing the container images
 You can access AIDA docker file and container images from the Entitled Registry:

 -  Contact your HCL sales representative for the login details required to access the Entitled Registry.
    
 -  Execute the following command to log in into the Entitled Registry:
    
    ```
     docker login -u <your_username> -p <your_entitled_key> hclcr.io
    
    ```
The images are as follows:
 
 - ``hclcr.io/wa/aida-ad:10.1.0.00`` 
 - ``hclcr.io/wa/aida-exporter:10.1.0.00``
 - ``hclcr.io/wa/aida-email:10.1.0.00``
 - ``hclcr.io/wa/aida-nginx:10.1.0.00``
 - ``hclcr.io/wa/aida-orchestrator:10.1.0.00``
 - ``hclcr.io/wa/aida-predictor:10.1.0.00``
 - ``hclcr.io/wa/aida-redis:10.1.0.00``
 - ``hclcr.io/wa/aida-ui:10.1.0.00``
 

 
  
### From HCL Flexera

If you are accessing the images from HCL Flexera source repository, run the following steps:
1. Untar the package locally.
2. From the [docker_deployment_dir] load all the docker images into your environment by running the following commands:

	For linux:
 
	 ``./AIDA.sh load``
	 
	 where AIDA.sh is the AIDA installation script: it provides options to run Docker Compose operations and AIDA configuration steps.
	 You can find the script in the installation package.
	 
	 
	For zlinux:
	
	``tar -xvzf aida-images.tgz``
	``for f in ./aida-images/aida-*.tar*; do cat $f | docker load; done``
	

	 

## AIDA structure
AIDA package includes the following containers: 

- **aida-ad** - Anomaly detection and alert generation service
- **aida-exporter** - Exporter service
- **aida-mail** - Email notification service 
- **aida-nginx** - As a reverse proxy for AIDA components
- **aida-orchestrator** - Orchestrator service
- **aida-predictor** - Predictor service
- **aida-redis** - Internal event manager
- **aida-ui** - AIDA UI
  

Also, AIDA uses:

 - **Keycloak** - To manage security and user access. Keycloak is optional: if used, it enables the creation of AIDA administrators who can access AIDA UI from outside the Dynamic Workload Console. Otherwise,  AIDA can only be accessed from the alert widget in the Workload Dashboard of the Dynamic Workload Console. 

 - **Elasticsearch** - To store and analyze data

 
## AIDA installation 
To install AIDA, run the following procedure: 

 1. Accept the product license by setting the LICENSE parameter to **accept** in the common.env file located in the [docker_deployment_dir] directory.
 2. To use custom SSL certificates for AIDA, in the <install_path>/nginx/cert folder replace aida.crt e aida.key with your own files (do not change the default names).
 3. Verify that the `DWC_PUBLIC_KEY` parameter in the common.env file is set to the DWC public key of the Liberty SSL certificates.

	If you are using custom certificates for the DWC, replace the `DWC_PUBLIC_KEY` value accordingly.
 4. In the common.env file, set the ``OPENSSL_PASSWORD``  parameter. This parameter will be used to generate an encryption key to hide the HCL Workload Automation engine credentials. (According to ISO, passwords must be encrypted inside the database) .
 5. If you want to customize the installation parameters, edit the common.env file. For details, see  [Configuration variables](#configuration-variables).
 6. Optionally, from [docker_deployment_dir], run the command
 
	 ``./AIDA.sh first-start``

     This command starts a guided configuration procedure. Follow the guided procedure and answer the prompts to configure AIDA with your settings.
   
 7.  Build, create, and start AIDA containers by running the command   
 
     ``./AIDA.sh build-start``

	 AIDA is now up and running.    
 8.  Configure the first server to be monitored by running the command 
 
     ``./AIDA.sh add-credentials``    
	
     This command starts a guided configuration of the server. 
	 For details, see [Managing Workload Automation server credentials](#managing-workload-automation-server-credentials).
    
9. If Keycloak is included in your AIDA deployment, you can connect AIDA user interface at the following link
 
	 ``https://aida-ip:aida-port/``
	
	 Specify ``aida-port`` only if it is different from the default value (9432). 
     Otherwise, AIDA can only be accessed from the alert widget in the Workload Dashboard of the Dynamic Workload Console. 

   **Note**: The **common.env** environment file contains all the environment variables. For details, see  [Configuration variables](#configuration-variables).   

## Managing Workload Automation server credentials
You can manage the credentials needed to connect to a WorkloadAutomation server using  AIDA.sh script. 
With a single AIDA instance you can monitor hybrid environments with a mix of HCL Workload Automation for distributed and z/OS systems.

**Limitations:**
With AIDA.sh script you can add, update, and delete credentials. You cannot list credentials since this function is not currently available.

To **add new credentials**, run the following steps:
 1. From [docker_deployment_dir], run the following command  
 
	 ``./AIDA.sh add-credentials``. 
	
	 A guided configuration procedure will start. 
 2. Follow the guided procedure and answer the prompts to add your credentials, specify the engine type (if HCL Workload Automation for distributed systems or HCL Workload Automation for Z) and, for HCL Workload Automation for Z only, also the engine name.

**Note:** If you are connecting HCL Workload Automation for distributed systems, you must use the Engine credentials.
If you are connecting HCL Workload Automation for Z, you must use the Dynamic Workload Console credentials instead.

To **update existing credentials**, run the following steps:
 1. From [docker_deployment_dir], run the following command   
 
	 ``./AIDA.sh update-credentials``. 
	
	 A guided configuration procedure will start.
 2. Follow the guided procedure and answer the prompts to add your credentials,   specify the engine type (if HCL Workload Automation for distributed systems or HCL Workload Automation for Z) and, for HCL Workload Automation for Z only, also the engine name.


To **delete existing credentials**, run the following steps:
1.	From [docker_deployment_dir], run the following command

	 ``./AIDA.sh delete-credentials``. 
	
	 A guided configuration procedure will start.
2.	 Follow the guided procedure and answer the prompts to delete your credentials.


## Updating AIDA installation

To update an existing AIDA installation, you just need to refresh AIDA images in the installation folder and rerun the installation steps:
1. ``./AIDA.sh down``
2. For linux:
 
	 ``./AIDA.sh load``
	 
	  
	 
	For zlinux:
	
	``tar -xvzf aida-images.tgz``
	``for f in ./aida-images/aida-*.tar*; do cat $f | docker load; done``
3. ``./AIDA.sh build-start``

 Existing configuration parameters are used.
 
## Uninstalling AIDA 

To uninstall AIDA, run the command 

``./AIDA.sh down``
	
This command will remove AIDA's container, saving data and configuration. 
To remove AIDA's containers and volumes, run the command
 
``./AIDA.sh down-volumes``


## AIDA.sh script 

``AIDA.sh`` script is available to manage AIDA deployment. It provides options to run Docker Compose operations and AIDA configuration steps. 
For the command usage, run  

``./AIDA.sh --help``

``Usage: ./AIDA.sh COMMAND [OPTIONS]``

``Commands:``

``load`` Loads AIDA's container images (required before the first start)

``first-start`` Helps setting up AIDA configuration for the first start

``build-start`` Builds, creates, and starts AIDA's containers (recommended for the first start)

``build`` Builds and creates AIDA's containers (without  starting  them)

``start`` Starts AIDA's containers (without building and creating them. Before the first start, run build or directly use build-start)

``stop`` Stops  AIDA's containers 

``restart``  Restarts  AIDA's containers

``down`` Removes  AIDA's containers (but  not  volumes)

``down-volumes``  Removes  AIDA's containers and volumes
